# slv-go-dapr-fn

### Goals
- Store the soil moisture level from an IoT sensor in a permissioned blockchain

### Overview

This repository contains the golang dapr function that acts as an intermediatory between an IoT sensor (which reports soil moisture level) and a permissioned blockchain. 

slv-go-dapr-fn exposes a simple REST that can be invoked by the sensor. The value provided by the sensor is committed to the ledger using the Serverless Ledger Variables golang library.
